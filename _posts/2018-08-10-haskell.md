# Introduction

It's been a while since my previous post, but it's been a crazy few months. I'm
happy to be able to write again, and I'll try to do it more regularly. This post
will be a bit different; it will be a personal and entirely subjective description
of my journey so far in functional programming. The reason I'm writing this now
is because I will soon start working at
[Runtime Verification](https://twitter.com/cvlad/status/1023957257841778688),
my first FP job.

## Background

I've been doing C# web development for about 15 years. Although I did not really
understand much of FP, I was an eager early adopter of all functional-style
features C# added over the years (LINQ, anonymous functions/lambdas, etc). Every
other year, I'd look up the latest Haskell books or tutorials and give it a go,
but it never really worked out for me due to various reasons (no real purpose,
no sense of achieving anything, not understanding the benefits of what I'm
learning, etc). Ultimately, I was never able to get past toy functions in the
interpreter. But I was very intrigued by Haskell's elegance.

## The FP Slack Community

One of the best decisions I made was to look up FP-related communities. I
stumbled upon the awesome [FP Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/)
community. That's where I found a bunch of passionate, helpful and very
knowledgeable people. They pointed me into the correct direction countless times
and helped me dodge frustrating experiences. Following is a list of the
pitfalls I ran into while learning Haskell, along with what I wish I knew
at the time.

### Installing Haskell

In my experience, the best way to install Haskell is using `stack`.
It's a cross-platform tool for developing Haskell projects, and it helps with
managing dependencies as well as GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler) versions for
each of your projects. Please check their
[documentation page](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) on how to
install. If you already have it, make sure you upgrade it via `stack upgrade`.

In order to start a new project, you can run:
```sh
vlad@rhaaw:~/code$ stack new project
vlad@rhaaw:~/code$ cd project
vlad@rhaaw:~/code/project$ stack build
vlad@rhaaw:~/code/project$ stack exec -- project-exe
```

You should now be able to edit either `app/Main.hs` or `src/Lib.hs` to change your
program.

### Writing Haskell Programs

I regret not listening to people's advice about this sooner and spending a lot
of time looking for the best Haskell IDE / development tools. In the end,
everybody else was right and unfortunately, the current state of the available
tools is _not good enough_. The process that most people seem to use, and the
one I also adopted is using my favorite text editor with syntax highlighting.
I have a few separate console windows that run `ghcid` and `ghci`.

`ghcid` is a lightning fast way to get feedback about your code as you work on
it. Once you are in your project's root, you can run `stack build ghcid` in
order to build the appropriate `ghcid` version for the current project's `GHC`.
Once you do that, you can run `ghcid` using
`stack exec -- ghcid -c "stack ghci project"`. As soon as you edit (and save)
any of the Haskell files in the project, it will recompile and let you know
if anything is wrong.

There are a few interesting tricks you can do with `ghcid`, out of which I'd
like to point out two that I find most useful. The first is really a GHC
feature, which really shines when used with `ghcid`. Whenever you're not sure
what to do in a function, you can throw in an underscore and save the file. The
compiler will figure out the type of what the underscore needs to be replaced
with, and will suggest functions in scope that match that pattern. This feature
is called typed holes, and if you want to read more about how it works, I suggest
you read
[Christoph Hegemann](https://twitter.com/kritzcreek)'s excellent thesis,
[Implementing type directed search for PureScript](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfkgafoo3mofvac/bachelor_arbeit_christoph_hegemann.pdf?dl=0).

The other trick with `ghcid` is, whenever you wish you had _hover-to-see-type_,
you can add parenthesis around that expression and add a type annotation, e.g.
`(whatTypeIsThis :: ())`. This basically asserts `whatTypeIsThis` has type `()`,
or `Unit`. When you save, you will get an error saying that `()` cannot be
unified with _actual type of the expression_ (of course, unless the type
actually is `()`).

The interactive Haskell shell is great when you want to try things out, or do a
quick test for a function you wrote. In order to launch it, you need to run
`stack ghci project`. You can then type `:l Lib` to load the `Lib` module. Once
you do that, you can execute any function defined in `Lib`. If you change the
code in your source files, you'll have to reload using `:r`.

### Looking up stuff

Whenever I need to look something up, my go-to place is
[hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/). You can search for functions or types by
name and by signature. This feature was very useful for me as a beginner, since
once you get a hang of types, you'll sort of know what signature of a function
you need but not know its name. As you look stuff up, I encourage you to look
at the source code of the functions you look up.

When looking for packages, start with [stackage](https://www.stackage.org/),
mostly because it will only show packages that are compatible with a certain
GHC version and among themselves. If you try to mix and match by yourself
through [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/browse), you might end
up with frustrating problems.

Once you find a package you'd like to add, you can edit the `package.yaml` file
under `dependencies` and just add the package you want by name. You'll need to
rebuild the project via `stack build`.

## The Haskell Book

The most recommended book on the FP slack is [Haskell Programming from first
principles](http://haskellbook.com/), and for good reason - it was
absolutely key in my learning process. It's filled with exercises guiding you
through the Haskell language, as well as excellent explanations and tips. There
isn't much more I can say other than, if you want to learn Haskell, this is
where you should start, and if you do, please work through the exercises.


## Blogs and other resources

There are a lot of awesome blogs and resources for Haskell out there, and I want
to mention particularly [Matt Parson's blog](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/) and
[Stephen Diehl's What I wish I knew when learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/)
as being excellent resources.

My personal interest in CS led me to reading several books on topics such as
Type Theory or Category Theory. They are in no way required or necessary in
order to learn Haskell, but they helped me and I think they are interesting:
* Bartosz Mileski's [blogs](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) / [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)
* David Spivak's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBeceQHz2x8) and books ([one](https://github.com/mmai/Category-Theory-for-the-Sciences) and [two](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/))
* [TAPL](https://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-MIT-Press/dp/0262162091)
* [Type Theory and Formal Proof](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Theory-Formal-Proof-Introduction/dp/110703650X)
* [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html) 

## Show and tell 

Soon after I started reading the Haskell Book, I started understanding the
benefits of FP. During this time, we were having some issues at work with the
quality of our TypeScript code base. The code was brittle and we were often
afraid to change it. I proposed we spent some time learning FP and try out
PureScript (which is very similar to Haskell, but generates JavaScript).

For the next few months, I went through the Haskell Book and presented it bit
by bit to my colleagues and did exercises together. This helped me immensely.
Just preparing the chapters in order to present them to other people does
wonders on your understanding; and actually presenting and trying to figure out
answers to their questions was important for me.

Once we went through most of the book, we turned to PureScript. This has
proven to be a very good choice for me, since PureScript is a slightly
more modern language, and being already comfortable with JavaScript helped a
lot. I was able to build useful software, while building apps that were
familiar, in an unfamiliar way. 

## Writing apps

Shortly after, we started prototyping applications in PureScript and integrating
them with our codebase. We were comfortable enough with the language to convince
our management and product owners to let us create a PoC using PureScript, and
they agreed. The results were impressive; we were able to develop the
application about as fast as we would in TypeScript, with less bugs and back and
forth with QA. The next app was even faster and the benefits more clear.

## Applying for the job

I was not sure I was ready to switch to a full-time Haskell job when I found out
about Runtime Verification and that they are hiring. In order to apply, I
completed the
[K Challenge](http://www.kframework.org/index.php/K_Project_Needs_Professional_Developers).
This was ideal for me since I knew I could use as much time as I wanted for it.
I ended up not needing too much time to get a decent implementation done, but
the ease of mind that I could do it at my own pace mattered a lot for me.

Moreover, I was personally interested in Formal Verification, and the RV
approach seems very appealing to me. I'm really happy to be able to be part of
the team working on the [Kore Language](https://github.com/kframework/kore).

## Closing thoughts

Because this is about Haskell, I've left out a lot of details about PureScript.
I believe PureScript, as well as its incredibly friendly community, were very
important in my journey. They helped me a lot and I'll try my best to give back
to this awesome community through code contributions and spreading the word.

I became a strong believer in FP, in strong typing, and in compilers guiding me
through programming. I strongly believe that any programmer can benefit from
learning Haskell. Even though I am still relatively new in this journey, I
consider myself a better programmer than I was when I started this journey and
I'm looking forward to learn more about Haskell, Type Theory, Category Theory,
and Formal Verification.

Without trying to sound too stuck up in my newly discovered FP ivory tower,
I'd like to point out that we, as programmers are extremely fortunate to get
very good pay compared to the standard we are held against, most of the time.
[Chris Allen](https://twitter.com/bitemyapp), one of the authors of the Haskell
Book [talks about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xyZeovFqCA) at
LambdaConf, but my takeaway from it is, there's no organization that takes away
our programmer's badge if we write terrible code or make bad decisions, or if we
fail to stay in touch with technology or practices. But we definitely should,
we should challenge ourselves to continuously learn, read other people's code,
contribute and, perhaps most importantly, work on projects outside of our
comfort zone.
