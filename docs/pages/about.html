        <p>Hey, I'm Evie! Welcome to my about page. I generally use this to
promote myself when I'm available for my next gig.</p>
<p>In the paragraphs below, you'll find what my <strong>core
values</strong> are in respect to leading teams.</p>
<p>You can also find my <strong>work experience</strong>, the
technologies I've worked with, and some of the responsibilities I've had
during this time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I talk about my <strong>technical interests</strong>, which
is basically the things that get me excited about technology and
computer science.</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>contact</strong> me, please use
<code>hello@eevie.ro</code>.</p>
<h2 id="my-core-values">My core values</h2>
<p>üëâ <strong>Empathy</strong>: I believe everyone wants to do their
best. By being honest, kind, and understanding with people, I can
empower them to do their best and feel good about the work they do.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Teamwork</strong>: Better yet than individuals doing their
best is a team that does its best. Holding regular team activities and
making sure the team is empowered to make decisions and have its
concerns heard is a great way to have teams that perform beter than the
sum of their parts.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Connection</strong>: There‚Äôs a lot of depth in both upper
management decisions and the work engineering teams perform on a daily
basis. It‚Äôs very easy for these to become disconnected, and for members
of either groups become enstrangered. It‚Äôs the Engineering Manager‚Äôs job
to act as a liason and ensure everybody is aligned and communicates
openly and effectively.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Mentorship</strong>: Tech is very dear to my heart. And
while I have no intention to veto any technical decisions made by my
team, I am there to ask the difficult questions, come up with unique
ideas and perspectives from my diverse experience, and help the team
make the best decisions they can.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Diversity</strong>: As a member of multiple marginalized
groups, I am keenly aware of the struggles that minorities face in tech.
The teams I lead strive to be inclusive, kind and welcoming to everyone.
These teams see diversity as power, ability to gain a better perspective
and unique views on the problems we face.</p>
<h2 id="my-work-experience">My Work Experience</h2>
<p>I have been doing tech professionally for over 15 years.</p>
<p>I started my career with C# and Javascript/Typescript developing
large-scale web applications and web services. At the mid-point of my
career, I decided to switch it up so I picked up Functional Programming
through Haskell, Purescript, and nix. I've been working with FP for over
6 years now.</p>
<p>I also have experience with compilers, theorem provers, GraphQL,
Postgres, database access proxies and libraries, a solid CS background
and a keen interest in theoretical computer science (type theory, lambda
calculus, abstract algebra, etc.).</p>
<p>I have more than 7 years of experience in leading teams as either
Team Lead or <strong>Engineering Manager</strong>. During this time, I
have've been responsible for</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>People</strong>: Handle recruitment, hold 1on1s, make sure
everyone is productive, happy, and heard.</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>Team</strong>: Team exercises and activities, games, help
individuals work and act as a team through a strong sense of team
ownership and camaraderie.</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>Process</strong>: Hold retrospectives, find bottlenecks,
resolve team dysfunctions, find creative and team and company-specific
ways to improve the way we work.</p>
<p>I have more than 8 years of doing individual contributions as a
<strong>Software Engineer</strong>:</p>
<p>üíª <strong>First Principles</strong>: I rely on both a strong
theoretical background and many years of personal experiences to make
informed decisions. I strongly believe in simplicity and clarity of code
and using the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>Learning</strong>: I learned Haskell, PureScript, Nix,
Scala, and Rust, as well as a lot of advanced math topics. I am always
learning new things and trying out new technologies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One fun and recent example is that I've used <a
href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a> to solve (the vast majority of)
the 2023 Advent of Code problems. Using a theorem prover/dependently
typed programming language to work on coding puzzles was a great <a
href="https://eevie.ro/posts/2023-12-21-lean-sigma.types.html">learning
experience</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>üíª <strong>Presentations</strong>: Held multiple presentations at
local FP user groups and the local University, work presentations and
workships, as well as a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpV8WbpuAKY">talk at Functional
Conf</a> about program testing and software verification.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>Community involvement</strong>: I'm an active member in
the FP community, currently holding a position on the <a
href="https://haskell.foundation/who-we-are/">Haskell Foundation
board</a>.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>CI/CD</strong>: I'm a strong believer in reproducible
builds, easy and predictable deployments, and consistent developer local
setup.</p>
<h2 id="my-technical-interests">My Technical Interests</h2>
<p>I am really interested in (theoretical) computer science, functional
programming languages, program verification and reproducible builds and
deployments.</p>
<p>I am often times using (theoretical) <strong>computer
science</strong> when working on technical projects. Using a common
<em>mathematical</em> language that has the benefit of having
<em>provable</em> and <em>testable</em> statements can greatly improve
technical <em>conversations</em>. I have successfully used theoretical
methods to <em>refactor</em>, <em>optimize</em>, and <em>clarify</em>
both small and large areas of code. I am mostly interested in
<strong>type theory</strong>, <strong>lambda calculus</strong>, and
<strong>abstract algebra</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Functional programming</strong> ties in very well with
theoretical computer science, and it's generally easier to translate FP
to theory and back (it's possible for all paradigms, but FP is closest).
I mostly have experience with <em>Haskell</em> and <em>Purescript</em>,
but a lot of languages can now be used in a functional style or share a
lot of features with functional programming languages (e.g. Elixir,
Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, Typescript, etc.).</p>
<p>Most programs have <strong>critical paths</strong> -- paths that can
cause a company to lose a lot of money or even fail of they contain
bugs. A lot of companies rely on engineer dilligence and automated
testing. And while these are absolutely critical, there's one more kind
of verification missing: we can <strong>formally prove</strong> these
critical paths are correct. One great example is Amazon's Cedar Policy
Language. It's an authorization policy language that has a Lean-based
implementation, proofs-included. This gives a different level of
<em>security</em> and <em>guarantees</em> to critical paths.</p>
<p>I really like <a
href="https://nixos.org/"><strong>nix/NixOS</strong></a>. I use it for
all my devices, which are highly customized (you can check my github
profile's <a
href="https://github.com/eviefp/dotfiles"><em>dotfiles</em></a> for
details!). And while my personal use is fun and interesting, nix shines
for <strong>sharing</strong> development environments by
<em>pinning</em> dependencies exactly and giving developers
<em>confidence</em> that their local build will be identical across
devices, team members, CI/CD, and production.</p>
