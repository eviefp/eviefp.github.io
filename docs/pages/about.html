        <p>Hey, I'm Evie! Welcome to my about page. I'll go through my core
values, my work experience, and my technical interests.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me, please use
<code>inquiries@eevie.ro</code>.</p>
<h2 id="my-core-values">My core values</h2>
<p>üëâ <strong>Empathy</strong>: I believe everyone wants to do their
best. By being honest, kind, and understanding with people, I can
empower them to do their best and feel good about the work they do.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Teamwork</strong>: Better yet than individuals doing their
best is a team that does its best. Holding regular team activities and
making sure the team is empowered to make decisions and have its
concerns heard is a great way to have teams that perform beter than the
sum of their parts.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Connection</strong>: There‚Äôs a lot of depth in both upper
management decisions and the work engineering teams perform on the daily
basis. It‚Äôs very easy for these to become disconnected, and for members
of either groups become enstrangered. It‚Äôs the Engineering Manager‚Äôs job
to act as a liason and ensure everybody is aligned.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Mentorship</strong>: Tech is still very dear to my heart.
And while I have no intention to veto any technical decisions made by my
team, I am there to ask the difficult questions, come up with unique
ideas and perspectives from my diverse experience.</p>
<p>üëâ <strong>Diversity</strong>: As a member of multiple marginalized
groups, I am keenly aware of the struggles of minorities in tech. The
teams I lead strive to be inclusive, kind and welcoming to everyone.
These teams see diversity as power, ability to gain a better perspective
and unique views on the problems we face.</p>
<h2 id="my-work-experience">My Work Experience</h2>
<p>I have been doing tech professionally for over 15 years.</p>
<p>I started my career with C# and Javascript/Typescript developing
large-scale web applications and web services. At the mid-point of my
career, I decided to switch it up so I picked up Functional Programming
through Haskell, Purescript, and nix. I've been working with FP for over
6 years now.</p>
<p>I also have a experience with compilers, theorem provers, GraphQL,
Postgres, database access proxies and libraries, a solid CS background
and a keen interest in theoretical computer science (type theory, lambda
calculus, abstract algebra, etc.).</p>
<p>I have more than 7 years of experience in leading teams as either
Team Lead or Engineering Manager. During this time, I have've been
responsible for</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>People</strong>: Recruit, hold 1on1s, make sure everyone
is productive, happy, and heard.</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>Teams</strong>: Team exercises, activities, and games,
help individuals work and behave as a team.</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏è <strong>Process</strong>: Hold retrospectives, align expectations
with upper management, experiment.</p>
<p>üó®Ô∏èÔ∏è <strong>Team Lead</strong>: Make high‚Äëlevel decisions with input
from team, mentor and train individuals on the team.</p>
<p>I have more than 8 years of doing individual contributions as a
software engineer:</p>
<p>üíª <strong>First Principles</strong>: I rely on both a strong
theoretical background and many years of personal experiences to make
informed decisions.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>Learning</strong>: I learned Haskell, PureScript, Nix,
Scala, and Rust, as well as a lot of advanced math topics. I am always
learning new things and trying out new technologies.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>Presentations</strong>: Held multiple presentations at
local FP user groups, multiple presentations at the local University,
work presentations and workships, as well as a talk at Functional
Conf.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>Community involvement</strong>: I became active in the FP
community, currently holding a position on the Haskell Foundation
board.</p>
<p>üíª <strong>CI/CD</strong>: I'm a strong believer in reproducible
builds, easy and predictable deployments, and consistent developer local
setup.</p>
<h2 id="my-technical-interests">My Technical Interests</h2>
<p>I am really interested in (theoretical) computer science, functional
programming languages, program verification and reproducible builds and
deployments.</p>
<p>I am often times using (theoretical) computer science when working on
technical projects. Using a common mathematical language that has the
benefit of having provable and testable statements can greatly improve
technical conversations. I have successfully used theoretical methods to
refactor, optimize, and clarify both small and large areas of code. I am
mostly interested in type theory, lambda calculus, and abstract
algebra.</p>
<p>Functional programming ties in very well with theoretical computer
science, and it's generally easier to translate FP to theory and back
(it's possible for all paradigms, but FP is closest). I mostly have
experience with Haskell and Purescript, but a lot of languages can now
be used in a functional style or share a lot of features with functional
programming languages (e.g. Elixir, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, Typescript,
etc.).</p>
<p>Most programs have critical paths -- paths that can cause a company
to lose a lot of money or even fail of they contain bugs. A lot of
companies rely on engineer dilligence and automated testing. And while
these are absolutely critical, there's one more kind of verification
missing: we can formally prove these critical paths are correct. One
great example is Amazon's Cedar Policy Language. It's an authorization
policy language that has a Lean-based implementation, proofs-included.
This gives a different level of security and guarantees to critical
paths.</p>
<p>I really like nix/NixOS. I use it for all my devices, which are
highly customized (you can check my github profile's dotfiles for
details!). And while my personal use is fun and interesting, nix shines
for sharing development environments by pinning dependencies exactly and
giving developers confidence that their local build will be identical
across devices, team members, CI/CD, and production.</p>
