        <p>In the intricate dance of innovation and project execution, the
linchpin holding the delicate balance is trust ‚Äî especially between
engineering teams and upper management. This foundational element serves
as the bedrock upon which collaborative efforts, efficient
communication, and successful outcomes rest.</p>
<h2 id="-common-signs-for-lack-of-trust">üöß Common Signs for Lack of
Trust</h2>
<p>There's usually a few <strong>signs</strong> you can look for to see
if there's a significant gap in trust between upper management and
engineering teams. Here's a short list of the most commonly found, in my
experience:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Turnover</strong> within the engineering team,</li>
<li><strong>Micromanagement</strong> and looking for hands-on/technical
staff to join the upper management team,</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to change</strong> from engineering teams to
embrace the vision and ideas coming from upper management,</li>
<li><strong>Secrecy</strong> or lack of transparency in the
decision-making process,</li>
<li><strong>Blame Culture</strong> focusing on pointing fingers rather
than finding solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>While some of these symptoms may cause others (for example,
micromanagement may increase turnover, secrecy might increase the team's
resistance to change, etc.), they're all caused by one thing:
<strong>lack of trust</strong> between upper management and the
engineering teams.</p>
<h2 id="Ô∏è-building-bridges-as-engineering-managers">üõ†Ô∏è Building Bridges
as Engineering Managers</h2>
<p>Instead of relying solely on technical prowess, consider empowering
your Engineering Managers to bridge this divide. Their role extends
beyond managing projects or solving technical problems; they are
instrumental in fostering a culture of trust. By actively engaging with
both upper management and the engineering teams, they can facilitate
open communication, align goals, and strengthen collaboration.</p>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>transparent and open
communication</strong> is key for everything else. Regularly updating
both the upper management and the engineering teams on progress,
challenges and successes is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Aligning goals and expectations</strong> is a close second
when it comes to building trust. The goals must be in line with the
upper management's vision and plans, while also being realistic and
accepted by the engineering teams: alignment is a two-way street.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition and acknowledgement</strong> is essential in
building trust. And this also goes both ways. The Engineering Manager is
responsible to make sure the engineering teams understand the essential
work that upper management does, just as much as the upper management
should know about the successes and achievements of the engineering
teams.</p>
<h2 id="-why-focus-on-trust">üí° Why Focus on Trust?</h2>
<p>A lack of trust can hinder innovation, slow down decision-making, and
impede the overall progress of engineering initiatives. Engineering
Managers, adept at navigating the technical landscape and interpersonal
dynamics, can play a pivotal role in rebuilding and nurturing this
essential foundation.</p>
<p>When trust is restored, it ripples through the organization,
positively impacting morale, productivity, and ultimately, the quality
of deliverables. Investing in the right leadership at the managerial
level can be a strategic move to address the root cause of the
disconnect.</p>
<h2 id="-connect-with-purpose">üîó Connect with Purpose</h2>
<p>Take a moment to consider your Engineering department's organisation.
Are you looking for someone hands-on/tehcnical in the upper management
because you don't trust your engineering teams? Is your company showing
signs for lack of trust?</p>
<p>If so, perhaps the solution is to empower your Engineering Managers
to bridge the trust gap.</p>
