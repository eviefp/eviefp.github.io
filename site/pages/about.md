Hey, I'm Evie! Welcome to my about page. I'll go through my core values, my work experience, and
my technical interests.

If you want to contact me, please use `inquiries@eevie.ro`.

## My core values

👉 **Empathy**: I believe everyone wants to do their best. By being honest, kind, and understanding with
people, I can empower them to do their best and feel good about the work they do.

👉 **Teamwork**: Better yet than individuals doing their best is a team that does its best. Holding
regular team activities and making sure the team is empowered to make decisions and have its
concerns heard is a great way to have teams that perform beter than the sum of their parts.

👉 **Connection**: There’s a lot of depth in both upper management decisions and the work engineering
teams perform on the daily basis. It’s very easy for these to become disconnected, and for members
of either groups become enstrangered. It’s the Engineering Manager’s job to act as a liason and
ensure everybody is aligned.

👉 **Mentorship**: Tech is still very dear to my heart. And while I have no intention to veto any
technical decisions made by my team, I am there to ask the difficult questions, come up with
unique ideas and perspectives from my diverse experience.

👉 **Diversity**: As a member of multiple marginalized groups, I am keenly aware of the
struggles of minorities in tech. The teams I lead strive to be inclusive, kind and welcoming
to everyone. These teams see diversity as power, ability to gain a better perspective and
unique views on the problems we face.

## My Work Experience

I have been doing tech professionally for over 15 years.

I started my career with C# and Javascript/Typescript developing large-scale web applications and
web services. At the mid-point of my career, I decided to switch it up so I picked up Functional
Programming through Haskell, Purescript, and nix. I've been working with FP for over 6 years now.

I also have a experience with compilers, theorem provers, GraphQL, Postgres, database access
proxies and libraries, a solid CS background and a keen interest in theoretical computer science
(type theory, lambda calculus, abstract algebra, etc.).

I have more than 7 years of experience in leading teams as either Team Lead or Engineering Manager.
During this time, I have've been responsible for

🗨️ **People**: Recruit, hold 1on1s, make sure everyone is productive, happy, and heard.

🗨️ **Teams**: Team exercises, activities, and games, help individuals work and behave as a team.

🗨️ **Process**: Hold retrospectives, align expectations with upper management, experiment.

🗨️️ **Team Lead**: Make high‑level decisions with input from team, mentor and train individuals on the
team.


I have more than 8 years of doing individual contributions as a software engineer:

💻 **First Principles**: I rely on both a strong theoretical background and many years of personal
experiences to make informed decisions.

💻 **Learning**: I learned Haskell, PureScript, Nix, Scala, and Rust, as well as a lot of
advanced math topics. I am always learning new things and trying out new technologies.

💻 **Presentations**: Held multiple presentations at local FP user groups, multiple presentations
at the local University, work presentations and workships, as well as a talk at Functional Conf.

💻 **Community involvement**: I became active in the FP community, currently holding a position on the
Haskell Foundation board.

💻 **CI/CD**: I'm a strong believer in reproducible builds, easy and predictable deployments, and
consistent developer local setup.

## My Technical Interests

I am really interested in (theoretical) computer science, functional programming languages, program
verification and reproducible builds and deployments.

I am often times using (theoretical) computer science when working on technical projects. Using
a common mathematical language that has the benefit of having provable and testable statements can
greatly improve technical conversations. I have successfully used theoretical methods to refactor,
optimize, and clarify both small and large areas of code. I am mostly interested in type theory,
lambda calculus, and abstract algebra.

Functional programming ties in very well with theoretical computer science, and it's generally
easier to translate FP to theory and back (it's possible for all paradigms, but FP is closest). I
mostly have experience with Haskell and Purescript, but a lot of languages can now be used in a
functional style or share a lot of features with functional programming languages (e.g. Elixir,
Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, Typescript, etc.).

Most programs have critical paths -- paths that can cause a company to lose a lot of money or even
fail of they contain bugs. A lot of companies rely on engineer dilligence and automated testing.
And while these are absolutely critical, there's one more kind of verification missing: we can
formally prove these critical paths are correct. One great example is Amazon's Cedar Policy
Language. It's an authorization policy language that has a Lean-based implementation,
proofs-included. This gives a different level of security and guarantees to critical paths.

I really like nix/NixOS. I use it for all my devices, which are highly customized (you can check
my github profile's dotfiles for details!). And while my personal use is fun and interesting, nix
shines for sharing development environments by pinning dependencies exactly and giving developers
confidence that their local build will be identical across devices, team members, CI/CD, and
production.
