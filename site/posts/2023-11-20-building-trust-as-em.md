In the intricate dance of innovation and project execution, the
linchpin holding the delicate balance is trust ‚Äî especially between
engineering teams and upper management. This foundational element
serves as the bedrock upon which collaborative efforts, efficient
communication, and successful outcomes rest.

## üöß Common Signs for Lack of Trust

There's usually a few **signs** you can look for to see if there's a
significant gap in trust between upper management and engineering
teams. Here's a short list of the most commonly found, in my
experience:

1. **High Turnover** within the engineering team,
2. **Micromanagement** and looking for hands-on/technical staff to join
the upper management team,
3. **Resistance to change** from engineering teams to embrace the vision
and ideas coming from upper management,
4. **Secrecy** or lack of transparency in the decision-making process,
5. **Blame Culture** focusing on pointing fingers rather than finding
solutions.

While some of these symptoms may cause others (for example,
micromanagement may increase turnover, secrecy might increase the
team's resistance to change, etc.), they're all caused by one thing:
**lack of trust** between upper management and the engineering teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building Bridges as Engineering Managers

Instead of relying solely on technical prowess, consider empowering
your Engineering Managers to bridge this divide. Their role extends
beyond managing projects or solving technical problems; they are
instrumental in fostering a culture of trust. By actively engaging with
both upper management and the engineering teams, they can facilitate
open communication, align goals, and strengthen collaboration.

First and foremost, **transparent and open communication** is key for
everything else. Regularly updating both the upper management and the
engineering teams on progress, challenges and successes is essential.

**Aligning goals and expectations** is a close second when it comes to
building trust. The goals must be in line with the upper management's
vision and plans, while also being realistic and accepted by the
engineering teams: alignment is a two-way street.

**Recognition and acknowledgement** is essential in building trust. And
this also goes both ways. The Engineering Manager is responsible to
make sure the engineering teams understand the essential work that
upper management does, just as much as the upper management should
know about the successes and achievements of the engineering teams.

## üí° Why Focus on Trust?

A lack of trust can hinder innovation, slow down decision-making, and
impede the overall progress of engineering initiatives. Engineering
Managers, adept at navigating the technical landscape and
interpersonal dynamics, can play a pivotal role in rebuilding and
nurturing this essential foundation.

When trust is restored, it ripples through the organization,
positively impacting morale, productivity, and ultimately, the quality
of deliverables. Investing in the right leadership at the managerial
level can be a strategic move to address the root cause of the
disconnect.

## üîó Connect with Purpose

Take a moment to consider your Engineering department's organisation.
Are you looking for someone hands-on/tehcnical in the upper management
because you don't trust your engineering teams? Is your company showing
signs for lack of trust?

If so, perhaps the solution is to empower your Engineering Managers to
bridge the trust gap.
